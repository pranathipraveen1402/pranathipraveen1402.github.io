This project aims to develop a user-friendly online movie booking system in Java to streamline the process of booking movie tickets, addressing the inconveniences of traditional methods. The system will allow users to register, browse movies, select showtimes and seats, process payments securely, and receive booking confirmations with e-tickets or references.

This project was built as a part of the course Object oriented analysis and Design. The code adheres to many design patterns and principles. The are SOLID, Singleton, Template and Proxies. The front-end is built using Thymeleaf, a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments. This was done in order to ensure the MVC architecture is followed. The database used is MongoDB.

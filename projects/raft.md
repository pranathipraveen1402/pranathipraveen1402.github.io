Objectives:
1. Implement a task management system with Raft consensus algorithm for distributed
coordination.

2. Utilise MySQL as the backend database to store task data.
   
3. Ensure fault tolerance and consistency across multiple nodes using Raft.

4. Enable users to perform CRUD operations on tasks via a user-friendly interface.

5. Demonstrate distributed system principles and fault tolerance mechanisms through
the application.

We built a front end using streamlit. The main features of this project included an interactive interface that allows users to add, delete, edit and read tasks. The aim was to achieve consistency across all nodes
